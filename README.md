These three projects show my journey in learning programming.
I started with FactorizationApp, then TemperatureApp, and finally TemperatureAppPlus.
Each project helped me improve my skills in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP),
MVC design, and building UI with Java Swing,
making my programs more complex and complete over time.
